# About me

Hello My name is Ishita(She/Her). I am a MISM 12 month student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I have a total of 6.5 years of work experience. I have worked in advanced java projects with Spring, Strut Hibernate frameworks. I have also worked on Front end developement using javascript ,JQuery and an Advanced Javascript framework such as EXTJs. My last few project before going back to school were on Salesforce.com.

I have spent the last 4 years working on Sales cloud platform of Salesforce CRM. I have worked extensively on force.com platform . I was also the technical lead for one of my projects where i was responsible for the deployment and delivery of each release. I want to achieve proficiency in coding and want to lead a generation of coders one day. After being in the IT industry for 6 years, i realize the importance of presenting strong case with use of data visualization. I truly beleive that strong coding skills, effective communication skills can help a person climb the ladder of success. I also believe that empathy and kind heart wins trust of people and so one must also strive for personal well being.

# What I hope to learn

Data visualization and presentation techniques are very important in todays times. Data visualization can be an extremely useful skill to have for presentations to managers/seniors/leaderships, negotiations with clients to prove a point. I strongly believe that data visualization is one of the most important skill to have and i hope that i am able to harness this skill of mine during this course and come out as someone who has strong ability to tell stories with data.
