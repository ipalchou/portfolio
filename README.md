# About me

Hello My name is Ishita(She/Her). I am a MISM 12 month student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I have a total of 6.5 years of work experience. I have worked in advanced java projects with Spring, Strut Hibernate frameworks. I have also worked on Front end developement using javascript ,JQuery and an Advanced Javascript framework such as EXTJs. My last few project before going back to school were on Salesforce.com.

I have spent the last 4 years working on Sales cloud platform of Salesforce CRM. I have worked extensively on force.com platform . I was also the technical lead for one of my projects where i was responsible for the deployment and delivery of each release. I want to achieve proficiency in coding and want to lead a generation of coders one day. After being in the IT industry for 6 years, i realize the importance of presenting strong case with use of data visualization. I truly beleive that strong coding skills, effective communication skills can help a person climb the ladder of success. I also believe that empathy and kind heart wins trust of people and so one must also strive for personal well being.

# What I hope to learn

Data visualization and presentation techniques are very important in todays times. Data visualization can be an extremely useful skill to have for presentations to managers/seniors/leaderships, negotiations with clients to prove a point. I strongly believe that data visualization is one of the most important skill to have and i hope that i am able to harness this skill of mine during this course and come out as someone who has strong ability to tell stories with data.

# Why i chose the third data visualization
I chose the third data visualization as a Treemap. The previous line graph was giving out too much information to the user and the user needs to go around all graphs to read the information. It is not necessary for the user see all graphs at once. A user may be interest in looking at the Highest GDP for year 2016 per se. They can look at the Tree for 2016 and see that Japan has the highest debt to GDP ratio since the area of rectangle of Japan is the largest.
The Treemap is given color scheme from light green to darker shades of green where each shade represents a decade. eg, 1995-2000 is light green, 2001-2010 is dark green and so on.
Each Tree is assigned to a year. And each tree has countries where larger the area of a rectangle of a country, greater is their GDP. This will at once give out the information that at any particular year, that country has the highest debt to gdp ratio. 
If the user wants to dig in more, they can click on each tree's border and an enlarged view of the tree for any particular year will come up. They can hover at any rectangle inside the tree to see the Debt to gdp ration precisely.
I chose green color as i identify green color with money and it would fit the context of Debt to GDP ratio.
