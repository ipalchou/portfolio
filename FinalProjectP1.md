# Bangladesh - A story of growth.

# Outline
I want to present a story of a country in South East Asia called Bangladesh.Bangladesh is exemplary in terms of its GDP Growth rate and its overall growth in the world. It is the third largest garment exported in the world.More than 20% of the GDP of bangladesh comes from exporting Garments. My Visualizations will talk about all these aspects of bangladesh.
I have around 7 visualizations in my story. 
Visualization 1: In this , I want to first highlight about where Bangladesh stands in GDP Ranking as compared to a few major.
Visualization 2: Next I want to show the how the GDP of bangladesh has been increasing in Billion USD from 2011 to 2020.
Visualization 3: Next I want to see the increase in the salaried population of bangladesh from 2011 to 2020.
Visualization 4: Next I want to highlight the population working in the garment industry. I also want to bring to the attention of the viewer that 80% of this population are women. The reference for this data was taken from https://borgenproject.org/garment-industry-in-bangladesh/
Visualization 5: Next I want to show the trend of exports in bangladesh from 2016 to 2020 and what percentage of those exports are exports of garments.
In my story, i would like to first present where Bangladesh stands in terms of GDP in the whole world . Some data has been referred from https://www.researchgate.net/figure/RMG-export-and-its-share-in-export-of-Bangladesh-1985-2019_fig1_350156796.
Visualization 6:  Next I want to showcase what is the value of export in Billion USD. of each year from 2011 to 2020.
Visualization 7: Lastly I want to show that bangladesh is the third largest exporter of garments in the world only after China and EU. This is something which is common knowledge available accross web . But i just want to convey this using visualization.

# Data
1. https://statisticstimes.com/economy/projected-world-gdp-ranking.php - This website has data of GDP of all countries in Billion USD.I plan to pick a few developed countries along with Bangladesh and highlight where bangladesh currently stands. 
2. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=BD - This website is uded to export data on the GDP growth of bangladesh . The data has been exported to excel. The idea behind this visualization is to show how bangladesh is continously improving over the years.
3. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN?locations=BD - This website is used to show case that the employment in bangladesh has improved significantly over the years and garments export is a major reason behind it.
4. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=BD - This website is used to extract data about the contribution of exports as a percent in the GDP of bangldesh. This will try to stress on the point that export especially in the garment industry is the driving factor of the economy.
5. https://www.statista.com/statistics/987707/bangladesh-export-value-garments/ - This website is used to extract data on the export value of garments in bangladesh as Billion USD. The intent is to show the trend of increase in the value of exports over the years.

# Method and medium

I plan to start cleaning my data first in order to build visualizations. Most of the data I have are in excel format but there are few which are present as data in news article. 
I need to extract those data and use it in my visualizations. I plan to use both flourish and tableau to create the charts for my visualization. I will make use of meaningful labels as it is very important in my case to convey the right message and context. I will using shorthand to do the entire story telling of my data.
  As of now , I dont plan to use any power point presentation. My concept of representing the growth of a country can be well represented by just the numbers in my chart and appropriate labels. I believe shorthand, tableau and flourish will be all I need for the final project presentation.
