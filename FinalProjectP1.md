# Bangladesh - A story of growth.

# Outline
I want to present a story of a country in South East Asia called Bangladesh.Bangladesh is exemplary in terms of its GDP Growth rate and its overall growth in the world. It is the third largest garment exported in the world.More than 20% of the GDP of bangladesh comes from exporting Garments. My Visualizations will talk about all these aspects of bangladesh.
I have around 7 visualizations in my story. 
Visualization 1: In this , I want to first highlight about where Bangladesh stands in GDP Ranking as compared to a few major.
Visualization 2: Next I want to show the how the GDP of bangladesh has been increasing in Billion USD from 2011 to 2020.
Visualization 3: Next I want to see the increase in the salaried population of bangladesh from 2011 to 2020.
Visualization 4: Next I want to highlight the population working in the garment industry. I also want to bring to the attention of the viewer that 80% of this population are women. The reference for this data was taken from https://borgenproject.org/garment-industry-in-bangladesh/
Visualization 5: Next I want to show the trend of exports in bangladesh from 2016 to 2020 and what percentage of those exports are exports of garments.
In my story, i would like to first present where Bangladesh stands in terms of GDP in the whole world . Some data has been referred from https://www.researchgate.net/figure/RMG-export-and-its-share-in-export-of-Bangladesh-1985-2019_fig1_350156796.
Visualization 6:  Next I want to showcase what is the value of export in Billion USD. of each year from 2011 to 2020.
Visualization 7: Lastly I want to show that bangladesh is the third largest exporter of garments in the world only after China and EU. This is something which is common knowledge available accross web . But i just want to convey this using visualization.

# Data
1. https://statisticstimes.com/economy/projected-world-gdp-ranking.php - This website has data of GDP of all countries in Billion USD.I plan to pick a few developed countries along with Bangladesh and highlight where bangladesh currently stands. 
2. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=BD - This website is uded to export data on the GDP growth of bangladesh . The data has been exported to excel. The idea behind this visualization is to show how bangladesh is continously improving over the years.
3. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN?locations=BD - This website is used to show case that the employment in bangladesh has improved significantly over the years and garments export is a major reason behind it.
4. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=BD - This website is used to extract data about the contribution of exports as a percent in the GDP of bangldesh. This will try to stress on the point that export especially in the garment industry is the driving factor of the economy.
5. https://www.statista.com/statistics/987707/bangladesh-export-value-garments/ - This website is used to extract data on the export value of garments in bangladesh as Billion USD. The intent is to show the trend of increase in the value of exports over the years.

# Method and medium


I need to extract those data and use it in my visualizations. I plan to use both flourish and tableau to create the charts for my visualization. I will make use of meaningful labels as it is very important in my case to convey the right message and context. I will using shorthand to do the entire story telling of my data.
  As of now , I dont plan to use any power point presentation. My concept of representing the growth of a country can be well represented by just the numbers in my chart and appropriate labels. I believe shorthand, tableau and flourish will be all I need for the final project presentation.

User research and interviews

User 1: Male, student at Heinz, 25 years old.
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
Story of growth of Bangladesh.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
 Bangladesh as a country grew in terms of GDP, salary, and exports over the years.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
In 2020 GDP of Bangladesh was more than Italy, Japan surprised me.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
New entrants in the textile industry.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I would recommend 
1. Adding numbers in the 'GDP Growth in Bangladesh from 1994 to 2020 (Billion USD)' graph to make it more clear.
2. What is the RMG sector? Mention full form and maybe brief about what it is.
3. Instead of adding all animations at the end of the page add specific animations just below the relevant explanation (for eg. animation of jeans below the '3 Largest garment exporters in the world' section would make more sense.

User 2: Male, student at Heinz, 25 years old.
- Can you tell me what you think this is? - When, I was casually browsing through the website, from the title I could understand that you were going to talk about Bangaldesh.
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you? As per my understanding, I could understand that you are trying to convey about how Bangladesh as a country is growing and the factors that are involved in its growth, by talking about all the positive factors that are contributing towards its growth. 
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? Only thing that I found confusing at first was, why were you comparing Bangladesh with only the strong nations, until I read the underline description. I was suprised to see the way you had built up the story, where first you started with a broader topic and then narrowed it down to one single sector (in your case the exports).
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this? Someone who would want to know about GDPs (students who are studying social studies ) or the economists, like the people who know the basics of economics and can comprehend and draw significance from the projected growth.
- Is there anything you would change or do differently? If you could talk more about RMG Sector, because I wasn't aware about what it is ?

User 3: Female, student at Heinz, 27 years old.
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
How is bangladesh affecting the worlds export industry and how has it improved overtime. Number of female workers more compared to male.
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- That Bangladesh is propespering.
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
   What is RMG. The visualization which shows export value , should mention that it is export value of Bangladesh.
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
A person in ready sector who wants to see where bangladesh stands in rmg export sector.
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
No


What I plan to do differently:
1.  I think I will get rid of the first graph comparing Bangladesh to major countries because it may not make sense to the audience why is Bangladesh being compared to these countries. A user has even misinterpreted an information that Bangladesh had higher GDP than Italy and Japan . I m9igh modify the graph to arrange it by order and add a line to denoted the average GDP of 2020 to make more sense or might get rid of this Graph entirely.
2.  I will add the information that RMG is Ready Made garment.
3.   I will re-think all the labels.
4.   I will make the animations consistent across all the visualizations. Right now I just have the draft version.

Changes made since part II
1.	In the part II of my project, the first chart which compared Bangladesh with developed countries such as USA, China, Italy wasn’t well interpreted by the audience who           critiqued the story. It misled some people to think that Bangladesh has better GDP than USA ,Italy. Hence I removed the graph from my story as I thought it will be more         useful to focus on just Bangladesh’s GDP.
2.	I used a Line graph for my first visualization as I thought it would clearly reflect the growth of Bangladesh’s GDP. 
3.	I used a scatter plot to reflect the growth in salaried population. 
4.	I plan to mention during presentation that there was a dip in GDP and employment in 2020 due to covid.
5.	I created a pie chart in flourish to reflect total population working in garment manufacturing using Paint. I thought it can be the simplest visualization to put forth the       idea that 80% of the population is that of female. Initially I did this using paint but pie chart is giving it a better look. The decision to move from paint to flourish was     done after having critiqued by another person. The similar feedback was used to change my last visualization where I used packed circles in flourish to point that Bangladesh     is the second largest Garments exporter in the world. The graph which denoted the export value of Bangladesh was changed from Treemap to bar chart.
6.	I have used a mix of flourish and Canva in creating my story in shorthand.
7.	There was another point mentioned during critique that it wasn’t clear what RMG means and I added the acronym of RMG in my story.
8.	I also reduce the GIF’s from the final slide to make it look subtle. 
9.	I tried to maintain consistency with respect to font, style and color throughout the story.
10.	The audience for my story is literally everyone who wants to improve their general knowledge. 
11.	I have also added a call to action where I mention that Bangladesh has many other goals to accomplish.
