# Bangladesh - Small country, big difference.
I want to present a story of a country in South East Asia called Bangladesh. Bangladesh is making exemplary progress to raise its GDP. It is the second largest garment exported in the world.
More than 20% of the GDP of bangladesh comes from exporting Garments. 
In my story, i would like to first present where Bangladesh stands in terms of GDP in the whole world . 
I want to point out the total workforce of bangladesh. Minimum wage of workers in bangladesh. Finally how much garments does it export every year and what value does that export have in the whole world.
